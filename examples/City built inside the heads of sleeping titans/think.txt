Okay, the user wants a JSON summary of a fictional world based on the description "City built inside the heads of sleeping titans." Let me break this down.

First, the world essence. It's a city within the minds of sleeping titans. So the core concept is a sentient city inside a titan's brain. Need to make sure it's from an intrinsic perspective, no external observers.

Primary constituents: The titans themselves, the city, maybe the minds of the titans. Each needs a name and description. Titans as massive beings, the city as a structure within their brains, and the minds as the collective consciousness.

Governing framework: Rules about the city's existence, how it interacts with the titans, maybe the structure of the titans' minds. Maybe the city's laws are based on the titans' thoughts.

Driving forces: The interaction between the city and the titans' consciousness, maybe the titans' dreams or memories affecting the city. Also, the city's role in maintaining the titans' slumber.

Foundational state: The titans are in a state of dormancy, their minds contain the city, and the city is sustained by the titans' neural activity.

Check for consistency. The city is inside the titans' heads, so the titans must be alive but sleeping. The city's existence depends on the titans' minds. The governing framework should include how the city functions within the titans' consciousness. Avoid real-world references, use terms like "neural structures" instead of specific biological terms unless necessary. Make sure all elements are internally consistent. No external observers, so the descriptions are from the city's or titans' perspective. Okay, that should cover it.
