Okay, the user wants a JSON summary of our Solar System based on the guidelines. Let me start by recalling the core elements of the Solar System. The world_essence should be a concise summary. Maybe something like "A gravitationally bound system of celestial bodies orbiting the Sun, encompassing a star, planetary bodies, and various smaller objects."

Next, primary_constituents. The main components are the Sun, planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Each needs a name and description. The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star. The planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Dwarf planets like Pluto. Moons are natural satellites. Asteroids in the asteroid belt, comets in the outer regions, and the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud as distant reservoirs.

Governing_framework: The fundamental rules. Gravity is the main force, with the Sun's gravity dominating. Orbits are elliptical, Kepler's laws. Planetary differentiation, asteroid belts as remnants, cometary orbits, and the Oort Cloud's role in comets. Also, the heliosphere and solar wind.

Driving_forces_and_potential: Solar radiation influencing climates, planetary orbits affecting seasons, asteroid and comet dynamics, potential for exoplanets, and the Sun's lifecycle. Also, the solar wind and magnetic fields.

Foundational_state: The Sun at the center, planets in specific orbits, asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Oort Cloud at the edge, and the heliosphere expanding from the Sun.

Need to make sure all descriptions are internal, no external observers. Check for consistency. Use scientific terms like "G-type main-sequence star," "elliptical orbits," "Keppler's laws," "heliosphere." Avoid real-world references beyond the Solar System. Ensure each part is a high-level summary without extra commentary. Validate JSON structure. Make sure all keys are present and correctly formatted.
