    "governing_framework": [
        "Gravity maintains the stone's position relative to the sand, preventing it from ascending or descending.",
        "The sand's granular structure allows for localized movement of particles but resists permanent displacement of the stone.",
        "The stone's mass and the sand's low density create a stable, albeit fragile, resting state.",
        "The environment contains no other significant matter or energy sources."

    "driving_forces_and_potential": [
        "The stone's potential to roll or shift if disturbed by external forces.",
        "The sand's potential to redistribute itself over time, altering the stone's position.",
        "The interplay between the stone's rigidity and the sand's fluidity, creating a transient equilibrium."
    ],
    "foundational_state": "The stone rests in a localized position on the sand, with the sand's surface in a state of continuous, slow reorganization, and the stone's form unchanged by external influences."
