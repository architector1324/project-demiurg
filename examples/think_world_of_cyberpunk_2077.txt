Okay, the user wants a JSON summary of the Cyberpunk 2077 world from an intrinsic, objective perspective. Let me start by recalling the key elements of the game. The world is set in a dystopian future with megacorporations, cybernetic enhancements, and a gritty urban environment. The main city is Night City, which is a sprawling metropolis with different districts.

First, the "world_essence" needs to be a concise summary. I should mention the cyberpunk themes, the conflict between corporations and the populace, and the technological advancements. 

Next, the primary constituents. There's Night City itself, which is a major component. Then the megacorporations like Nanonext and Cyberdyne. Also, the Undercity, which is the impoverished area. The Neon Gods, which are the powerful entities controlling the world. And the Net, the cybernetic network that connects everything. Each of these needs a description that's internal and consistent.

For the governing framework, I need to list the fundamental rules. The corporate dominance, the cybernetic integration, the law enforcement (like the Night City Police), and the social stratification. These should be stated as systems that govern the world.

Driving forces and potential would include the conflict between corporations and the people, the evolution of technology, the struggle for power, and the impact of the Net on society. These are the main interactions that drive the world forward.

The foundational state should describe the initial conditions. The collapse of the old world, the rise of corporations, the division into districts, and the existence of the Net. This sets the stage for the world's current state.

I need to make sure there are no real-world references beyond what's necessary. For example, using "Nanonext" and "Cyberdyne" as fictional corporations is okay. Also, terms like "Neon Gods" are part of the game's lore. The descriptions should avoid any external observers or game mechanics. 

Check for consistency: All elements should fit together without contradictions. The corporations control the city, the Net is a key part of the infrastructure, the Undercity is a lower district, and the Neon Gods are the ruling entities. The governing frameworks include the corporate rule, cybernetic integration, law enforcement, and social hierarchy. 

I should also ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with all keys present and proper formatting. No markdown, just valid JSON. Let me double-check each part to make sure it's accurate and aligns with the game's setting.
