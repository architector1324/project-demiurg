      "name": "Energy",
      "description": "The fundamental force that drives actualization, manifesting as kinetic, thermal, or informational energy, which can be sustained or depleted based on interaction with other entities."

      "name": "Void",
      "description": "The state of non-actualization, an absence of defined form or function, where unactualized potential dissolves into amorphous nothingness without permanent residue."

  "governing_framework": [
    "The Law of Actualization: Existence is proportional to the degree of actualization, with higher actualization states manifesting as stable, defined entities.",
    "The Principle of Dynamic Equilibrium: Systems adjust their actualization levels to maintain balance between energy, entities, and void within localized regions.",
    "The Boundary of Perceptibility: Objects below a threshold of actualization become imperceptible to observers, existing only in potential until sufficient energy is directed toward them.",
    "The Principle of Resonant Interaction: Changes in actualization propagate through spacetime as waves, altering the actualization states of nearby entities and void."

  "driving_forces_and_potential": [
    "The Flow of Potential: A universal force that seeks to actualize unmanifested possibilities, often leading to spontaneous emergence of new entities from void.",
    "The Echo of Necessity: Necessary entities (e.g., stable structures, essential information) tend to actualize at higher rates due to inherent stabilizing properties.",
    "The Fracture of Absence: Areas of extreme void instability can cause localized collapses, where existing entities dissolve into void and new ones form in chaotic bursts.",
    "The Nexus of Interaction: Conscious or unconscious interactions between entities can amplify or diminish actualization, creating feedback loops that shape reality."
  ],
  "foundational_state": "The world began as a state of balanced actualization, with entities and energy in equilibrium, and void as the baseline. Over time, fluctuations in energy distribution created regions of varying actualization, leading to the emergence of structured domains and void pockets."
