      "name": "Water Droplet",

      "name": "Vacuum Environment",
      "description": "A region of near-zero pressure, devoid of air, with minimal molecular interactions except for those governed by quantum vacuum fluctuations."

      "name": "Interstellar Medium",
      "description": "A sparse, ionized gas and cosmic radiation field that interacts weakly with the water droplet, influencing its thermal and chemical state."

  "governing_framework": [
    "In a vacuum, water sublimes at temperatures below 100°C, but surface tension in microgravity maintains its liquid state temporarily.",
    "Thermal radiation from nearby stars causes gradual evaporation, with vapor molecules escaping into the interstellar medium.",
    "Quantum vacuum fluctuations provide negligible thermal energy, keeping the droplet in a metastable state.",
    "Cosmic radiation induces ionization, altering the droplet's molecular structure over time."
  ],
  "driving_forces_and_potential": [
    "Sublimation driven by thermal gradients and radiation exposure.",
    "Surface tension maintained by molecular cohesion in microgravity.",
    "Radiative ionization leading to gradual molecular degradation.",
    "Potential for condensation if the droplet encounters a localized region of higher pressure."

  "foundational_state": "The water droplet exists at a temperature of 150 K (-133°C) and a pressure of 10^-10 Pa, suspended in a region of space with an average radiation dose of 10^-12 W/m², with no molecular interactions except those inherent to water's quantum vacuum state."
