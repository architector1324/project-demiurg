# Semantic Reality Generation Engine (SRGE)

**Semantic engine for generating internally coherent fictional realities — from quantum voids to dreaming cities, using prompt-driven LLM world synthesis.**

## Overview

**SRGE** is a tool that transforms natural language prompts into self-consistent,representations of fictional worlds. It leverages a structured system prompt and large language models (LLMs) to produce semantic JSON outputs that describe complex, internally coherent realities.

Whether you're building a simulation, narrative universe, or abstract conceptual model, SRGE provides a foundation grounded in pure semantic structure.

## Core Features

- **Prompt-driven generation** of fictional realities
- **Structured JSON output** with five key world dimensions:
  - `world_essence`
  - `primary_constituents`
  - `governing_framework`
  - `driving_forces_and_potential`
  - `foundational_state`
- **Genre-aware**, internally consistent synthesis
- **No player/game framing** — purely intrinsic world logic

| Command      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--new`      | Generate a completely new reality from a short prompt                      |
| `--explore`  | Investigates the existing reality based on already generated JSON.  |
| `--deep`     | Dive into a specific constituent or subsystem and elaborate it semantically|
| `--live`     | Experimental: simulate dynamic evolution based on internal world forces    |
