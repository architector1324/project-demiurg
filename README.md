# Project Demiurg

![](logo.png)

**Project Demiurg** - a generative system representing a semantic engine for creating internally coherent fictional realities, utilizing world synthesis based on text queries (prompts) and LLMs according to the SRGC representation model.

## Overview

**DEMI** (the **Project Demiurg Engine** tool) is a tool that transforms text queries into **self-contained fictional realities**, structured according to the **SRGC representation model**. Using a multi-agent system based on local **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), it generates semantic [JSON](https://www.json.org) structures that do not just describe but form the foundation for the existence and evolution of complex worlds in accordance with their own internal logic, adhering to **SRGC** principles.

Whether you are creating a simulation, a narrative universe, or an abstract conceptual model, DEMI provides a fundamental structure rooted in pure semantic meaning.

---

## Key Concepts

To fully understand DEMI, it is crucial to distinguish between the engine itself and the unique model of reality it uses and generates.

### Project Demiurg Engine
**DEMI (Project Demiurg Engine)** is a **generative system, an engine, and a tool** that **performs the process of generating, unfolding (manifesting), and querying** worlds. It accepts user prompts and, using LLMs, creates or modifies world structures. DEMI is the **mechanism** that allows you to interact with reality.

### SRGC Representation Model
**SRGC (Semantic Reality with Gradient Concretization)** is a conceptual model of semantic reality with gradient concretization. It is a **unique conceptual model, a metaphysical structure, or the "nature" of reality itself** that DEMI generates and interacts with. Unlike traditional, static ontologies, SRGC describes a reality where entities exist in a **gradient spectrum of concretization** - from abstract concepts and undifferentiated groups to precisely manifested components.

**Key idea of SRGC:** World details initially exist in a state of **potential and uncertainty**, and they **"materialize" (manifest)** on demand, without violating the world's internal logic. This allows a world to contain, for example, both **concrete, fully manifested entities** and **undefined groups**. SRGC allows reality to be **partially concretized** until the moment of "observation." For instance, "one apple" and "the remaining apples in the basket" can coexist correctly in one SRGC-structure, where "remaining apples" is an entity with the potential for further concretization, not an error.

**World as Synergy:** A world in DEMI is an **emergent reality** that arises from the synergy between a structured map (JSON, created by the SRGC model) and a language model (LLM). The JSON is not the world itself, but its **potential**, containing meanings and rules. The LLM is not just a text generator, but the **engine** that **unveils** this potential. Together, they create a **micro-dimension** - a dynamic, logically coherent system that you can explore using commands like `navigate` and `query`. This is not static text or imagination, but a living informational reality existing in the process of interaction.

## Interactive Exploration

For a more intuitive understanding of DEMI's structured outputs, we offer tools for visualizing generated realities.

### Project Website

For a general overview of DEMI and an integrated experience, a dedicated [project website](https://architector1324.github.io/project-demiurg/index.html) is available.

### Local Visualizer

An interactive graph visualizer is available for local use, allowing you to explore the **gradient concretization structure** of DEMI worlds directly on your machine.

*   **Location:** The standalone visualizer is located at [`visualizer/visualizer.html`](./visualizer/visualizer.html) in this repository.
*   **Usage:** Open `visualizer.html` in your web browser. You can paste any generated DEMI JSON output into the text field or load an example to see its internal structure as a dynamic, unfolding graph.

## Getting Started

### ChatGPT
If you're curious about DEMI's unique approach to reality generation and how it handles seemingly impossible concepts like infinite detail in a finite file? We've recorded a real conversation with **ChatGPT** that serves as an accessible introduction to DEMI's key ideas, philosophy, and practical applications, **especially in how it generates and allows navigation of realities based on SRGC.**

**The full dialogue is available here:** [DEMI: Explanatory Introduction Dialogue](./ChatGPT/ChatGPT_explanation.md)

### Example World

To better understand the structure of realities generated by **DEMI**, let's consider an example of the simplest world - "a stone lying on sand." This world is created using the `demi create` command, which takes a brief text query (prompt) and uses an LLM (in this case, `qwen3:4b`) to form the initial SRGC structure of the world.

```bash
demi create 'Very simple reality: a stone lying on sand' --core qwen3:4b --output world.json
```

Below is the JSON output, which serves as the "blueprint" or **potential** of this newly created world, structured according to the SRGC model. It contains five key dimensions describing fundamental aspects of reality:

```json
{
  "discovery": {
    "date": "2025-07-06 15:31:54",
    "core": "qwen3:4b",
    "prompt": "Very simple reality: a stone lying on sand",
    "seed": 1135929174
  },
  "navigation": {
    "max_depth": 0,
    "history": []
  },
  "world": {
    "essence": "A static, physical arrangement of a stone resting on a granular substrate, governed by fundamental physical and environmental principles.",
    "primary_constituents": [
      {
        "name": "Stone",
        "description": "A solid, inorganic object composed of crystalline mineral structures, exhibiting rigidity and resistance to deformation."
      },
      {
        "name": "Sand",
        "description": "A granular, inorganic material consisting of tiny, irregularly shaped particles of silicate minerals, characterized by low cohesion and high surface area."
      }
    ],
    "governing_framework": [
      "Gravity as a universal force maintaining the stone's contact with the sand.",
      "Physical properties of the stone (density, rigidity) and sand (porosity, friction) determining stability.",
      "Environmental context of a dry, terrestrial surface with minimal atmospheric interaction."
    ],
    "driving_forces_and_potential": [
      "Gravitational attraction between the stone and the sand's underlying substrate.",
      "Mechanical interlocking between the stone's surface and sand particles.",
      "Potential for translational motion if external forces alter the sand's structure."
    ],
    "foundational_state": "The stone occupies a localized spatial position above a contiguous sand surface, with no net movement and equilibrium between the stone's mass and the sand's granular support."
  }
}
```

**Structure Breakdown:**

*   **`discovery`**: Metadata about the world creation process – date, the LLM model used (`core`), the initial prompt (`prompt`), and a `seed` for reproducibility.
*   **`navigation`**: Internal data used by DEMI to track the depth of detail (`max_depth`) and the history of "dives" into the world (`history`). In the initial world, `max_depth` is always `0`.
*   **`world`**: The central object containing the semantic description of reality. It consists of five main fields that form its foundation:
    *   **`essence`**: The fundamental nature and concept of this specific world. Here, it is "a static, physical arrangement of a stone resting on a granular substrate."
    *   **`primary_constituents`**: The main entities or elements that make up the world at this level of abstraction. In this case, "Stone" and "Sand". Note that they are only described at a high level; their deeper details still exist in a state of potential.
    *   **`governing_framework`**: The laws and rules governing the world's functioning and the interaction of its components. For "stone on sand," these are gravity, physical properties of materials, and the environment.
    *   **`driving_forces_and_potential`**: Dynamic forces stimulating potential evolution, changes, or states within the world. Here, these are the forces holding the stone in place and the potential for movement.
    *   **`foundational_state`**: The initial, equilibrium state from which reality originates. For our world, it's "the stone occupies a localized spatial position above a contiguous sand surface...".

This JSON is not just text, but a **self-contained, internally logical informational structure** that awaits "observation" to reveal its infinite detail, as will be shown in the [Semantic Navigation](#semantic-navigation) section.

## Use Cases

Explore a wide range of generated worlds and evaluate DEMI's capabilities in action, from scientifically accurate systems to fictional universes and abstract concepts.

**View the full catalog of examples here:** [Catalog of DEMI World Generation Examples (Outdated)](./examples/old/examples.md)

## Motivation

DEMI was born from a desire to explore the true capabilities of large language models beyond simple conversation or data extraction. It represents a **metaphysical experiment** - a search for a way to use LLMs as semantic engines capable of constructing self-sufficient, internally consistent realities, **governed by SRGC**.

The project's goal is to demonstrate that even smaller, locally run models can serve as a "semantic core," allowing the creation and simulation of complex worlds at any level of detail, entirely independent of external human interpretation, **in accordance with its principles**. This project challenges the very notion of what constitutes "reality" and how it can be synthetically generated **through the lens of SRGC.**

---

## Key Features

DEMI provides a unique set of capabilities for creating and exploring complex, internally consistent fictional realities based on the **SRGC** (Semantic Reality with Gradient Concretization) model. Here are the main features:

### Reality Generation from Text Prompts

- DEMI transforms short text queries into unique, detailed realities, fully tailored to your vision.
- Each reality is formed in accordance with SRGC principles, ensuring logical integrity and depth.

### Structured World Representation

- Realities are presented as **JSON structures** that serve as a "blueprint" of the world, describing it through five key dimensions:
  - **essence**: The fundamental nature and concept of reality.
  - **primary_constituents**: The main entities or elements comprising the world.
  - **governing_framework**: The laws and rules governing the world's functioning.
  - **driving_forces_and_potential**: Dynamic forces stimulating evolution and changes.
  - **foundational_state**: The initial state from which reality originates.
- This structure doesn't just describe the world; it defines its internal logic and potential.

### Internal Consistency and Versatility

- DEMI creates **genre-independent** realities, from quantum physics to cyberpunk, maintaining their internal logical coherence.
- Worlds exist independently of the user, without player orientation, which distinguishes DEMI from traditional game or narrative engines.

### "Reality as Observation" Principle

- DEMI worlds possess the potential for infinite detail, but their details remain in a state of **potentiality** until "observed" via the `navigate` command.
- Inspired by quantum mechanics, this process (SRGC's gradient concretization) unveils world details without violating its internal logic.
- The user does not create or modify the world but merely prompts it to **unfold** an already existing semantic structure, ensuring absolute consistency.

### Autonomy and Local Operation

- DEMI runs entirely locally using Ollama, requiring no internet connection.
- This provides an autonomous, self-sufficient environment for generating and exploring realities.

### Semantic Power of LLMs

- The LLMs used (e.g., `qwen3:4b`, `qwen3`) act as a "semantic core," revealing the world's complexity through query interpretation.
- The LLM does not generate arbitrary content but acts as a tool that manifests the world's internal logic, defined by SRGC.

positional arguments:
  prompt                Short text prompt for reality generation.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output, -o OUTPUT   Specify an output file to save the generated reality (e.g., JSON).
  --core, -c {gemma3n,smollm2,qwen3:4b,qwen3,gemma3}
                        Specify the Ollama model to use as semantic core. Available models: gemma3n, smollm2, qwen3:4b, qwen3, gemma3

```

#### Navigate

The `navigate` function allows you to traverse and semantically unfold the inherent, granular details of an existing world. This is not arbitrary generation; the world automatically reveals its pre-existing complexity and structure upon targeted "observation," strictly adhering to its internal logic:

```bash
usage: demi navigate [-h] [--input INPUT] [--output OUTPUT] [--win WIN] prompt

positional arguments:
  prompt               Prompt to guide the navigation and elaboration.

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --input, -i INPUT    Specify an input file containing an existing reality.
  --output, -o OUTPUT  Specify an output file to save the explored reality (e.g., JSON).
  --win, -w WIN        Specify the maximum context window size (in tokens) for the model during this operation.
```

#### Query

The `query` function allows you to ask questions about a generated world through semantic questions and answers. Responses are derived exclusively from the world's internal logic - not guessed or fabricated:

```bash
usage: demi query [-h] [--input INPUT] [--output OUTPUT] [--think] [--win WIN] prompt

positional arguments:
  prompt               Specific query to investigate the reality.

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --input, -i INPUT    Specify an input file containing an existing reality.
  --output, -o OUTPUT  Specify an output file to save the query results (e.g., Markdown).
  --think, -t          Enable advanced, iterative reasoning for the model to refine outputs. May increase processing time and token usage.
  --win, -w WIN        Specify the maximum context window size (in tokens) for the model during this operation.
```

#### Live

The `live` function will simulate the dynamic evolution and events within a generated world based on its internal forces and rules. Not implemented, planned for the future.

## Semantic Navigation

The `navigate` command is the primary tool for exploring and unveiling the detailed layers of a generated reality, based on the **SRGC** (Semantic Reality with Gradient Concretization) model. It implements the principle of **"reality as observation,"** where world details exist in a state of potentiality and manifest only upon targeted request, preserving internal logic.

### How Navigation Works
- The user specifies a focus point (e.g., "A drop of water") via a text query.
- The LLM, guided by a system prompt, interprets the query as a **semantic lens**, determining a logical path within the world's structure.
- The command recursively unfolds hierarchical levels, adding `manifestation` objects to the world's JSON structure, revealing details in accordance with SRGC.

### "Reality as Observation" Principle
- World details are initially in a state of **potentiality**, similar to quantum mechanics, and "materialize" only upon "observation" via `navigate`.
- The user does not create new reality but merely prompts the world to reveal its already existing complexity, strictly adhering to its internal logic.
- This ensures complete **internal consistency**, as the LLM acts as an "unveiler" of the semantic structure, not an arbitrary generator.

### Key Features
- **Hierarchical Consistency**: Each `manifestation` object includes its own `essence`, `primary_constituents`, `governing_framework`, `driving_forces_and_potential`, and `foundational_state`, which logically derive from the parent entity and the world's general laws.
- **Semantic Unfolding**: The LLM interprets the query, finding a path to the requested entity. For example, querying "Woman at a table in a restaurant" in a world described up to "New York" unfolds the chain: `City -> District -> Building -> Restaurant -> Table -> Woman`.
- **Focused Detailing**: For large entities, DEMI highlights key subcomponents, consolidating others into generalized entities (e.g., "Other Components") to avoid redundant data.
- **Internal Logic**: The output describes the world from within, without an external perspective, emphasizing the reality's independence from the observer.

### Result
- The command returns an updated world JSON, where the specified entity is augmented with a new level of detail.
- This allows recursive exploration of reality, creating an increasingly detailed **SRGC-structured map**.

### Example

Let's look at how the `navigate` command gradually reveals world details, demonstrating the principle of **"reality as observation."**

#### World Creation

First, let's create a basic world using the `demi create` command:

```bash
demi create 'Very simple reality: a stone lying on sand' --core qwen3 --output world.json
```

At this stage, `world.json` will contain a high-level description of the world. Note the structure of the five key dimensions (`essence`, `primary_constituents`, `governing_framework`, `driving_forces_and_potential`, `foundational_state`):

```json
{
  "discovery": {
    "date": "2025-06-26 21:46:22",
    "core": "qwen3",
    "prompt": "Very simple reality: a stone lying on sand",
    "seed": ... /* ... */
  },
  "navigation": {
    "max_depth": 0, // Depth is 0
    "history": []
  },
  "world": {
    "essence": "A minimalist physical system where a solid object rests in static equilibrium on a granular medium.",
    "primary_constituents": [
      {
        "name": "stone",
        "description": "A discrete, rigid, non-fluid mass characterized by its resistance to deformation and gravitational inertia.",
      },
      {
        "name": "sand",
        "description": "A granular, semi-fluid aggregate composed of countless minute, irregularly shaped particles in continuous dynamic interaction.",
      }
    ],
    "governing_framework": [
      "Gravitational attraction between mass and the local spatial field",
      "Mechanical stability of discrete objects within a granular medium",
      "Thermal equilibrium between macroscopic and microscopic components"
    ],
    "driving_forces_and_potential": [
      "Gravitational potential energy gradient maintaining the stone's position",
      "Intergranular frictional forces stabilizing the sand's structure",
      "Thermal motion of particles in the sand medium"
    ],
    "foundational_state": "The stone occupies a stable equilibrium position within the sand matrix, with no net movement or energy transfer between constituents."
  }
}
```

This is the initial, "unmanifested" state of the world, where details exist only in potential. `max_depth` is 0, as we haven't delved yet.*

#### Delving into the Stone

Now, let's ask DEMI to "manifest" the details of the "Stone" entity within the current world:

```bash
demi navigate 'Камень' --input world.json --output world.json
```

After this command, `world.json` will be updated. Notice how a new `"manifestation"` block has been added to the `"Stone"` object, containing its detailed description using the same SRGC model.

```json
{
  "discovery": { /* ... world creation information */ },
  "navigation": {
    "max_depth": 1, // Depth increased
    "history": [
      // Navigation history added
      {
        "date": "2025-06-26 21:51:31",
        "prompt": "stone"
      }
    ]
  },
  "world": {
    "essence": "A minimalist physical system where a solid object rests in static equilibrium on a granular medium.", /* ... original world description */
    "primary_constituents": [
      {
        "name": "stone",
        "description": "A discrete, rigid, non-fluid mass characterized by its resistance to deformation and gravitational inertia.",
        "manifestation": { // NEW BLOCK: Stone's detailed manifestation
          "essence": "A macroscopic, rigid, non-fluid mass composed of aggregated mineral particles exhibiting structural cohesion and resistance to deformation.",
          "primary_constituents": [
            {
              "name": "Quartz Crystal",
              "description": "A representative mineralogical component characterized by its tetrahedral atomic structure and isotropic mechanical properties."
            },
            {
              "name": "Remaining Mineral Particles",
              "description": "A collective aggregate of silicate and metallic mineral fragments forming the bulk of the stone's macrostructure through interlocking crystalline lattices."
            }
          ],
          "governing_framework": [
            "Cohesive bonding between mineral lattice nodes",
            "Structural stress distribution across crystalline interfaces",
            "Thermal expansion anisotropy of constituent minerals"
          ],
          "driving_forces_and_potential": [
            "Crystal lattice resonance maintaining structural integrity",
            "Interfacial frictional forces resisting external displacement",
            "Thermally induced microfracture propagation potential"
          ],
          "foundational_state": "A polycrystalline matrix with 78% quartz, 15% feldspar, and 7% mica by volume, exhibiting 0.3 MPa compressive stress distribution across grain boundaries at 25°C."
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "sand",
        "description": "A granular, semi-fluid aggregate composed of countless minute, irregularly shaped particles in continuous dynamic interaction."
      }
    ],
    "governing_framework": [ /* ... world laws */ ],
    "driving_forces_and_potential": [ /* ... world driving forces */ ],
    "foundational_state": "The stone occupies a stable equilibrium position..." /* ... */
  }
}
```

*We "observed" the stone, and the world revealed its internal structure by adding a detailed `manifestation` block. `max_depth` increased to 1, and `history` tracks our path. Note that `primary_constituents` within the "stone's" `manifestation` now describe its components, such as "Quartz Crystal."*

#### Delving into the Sand

Similarly, let's unveil the details of the "Sand" entity. This happens in the same `world.json` file, augmenting it:

```bash
demi navigate 'Песок' --input world.json --output world.json
```

Now the `"sand"` object also contains a `"manifestation"` block. The already manifested details of the "stone" (and its `manifestation`) remain unchanged.

```json
{
  "discovery": { /* ... */ },
  "navigation": {
    "max_depth": 1, // Depth remains the same, as this is a parallel branch at the first level
    "history": [
      { "date": "2025-06-26 21:51:31", "prompt": "stone" },
      { "date": "2025-06-26 22:05:43", "prompt": "sand" } // New history entry added
    ]
  },
  "world": {
    "essence": "A minimalist physical system...", /* ... */
    "primary_constituents": [
      {
        "name": "stone",
        "description": "A discrete, rigid, non-fluid mass...",
        "manifestation": { /* ... full manifestation block for "stone" from previous step */ }
      },
      {
        "name": "sand",
        "description": "A granular, semi-fluid aggregate composed of countless minute, irregularly shaped particles in continuous dynamic interaction.",
        "manifestation": { // NEW BLOCK: Sand's detailed manifestation
          "essence": "A semi-fluid, dynamically interacting aggregate of minute, irregularly shaped particles exhibiting collective behavior through intergranular forces and continuous microscale motion.",
          "primary_constituents": [
            {
              "name": "Granular Particle",
              "description": "A representative minute, irregularly shaped unit characterized by its variable size distribution, angularity, and surface roughness, capable of independent motion within the aggregate."
            },
            {
              "name": "Bulk Granular Aggregate",
              "description": "A collective state of interlocked, continuously interacting particles forming a transient, semi-fluid medium with emergent properties arising from particle-scale interactions."
            }
          ],
          "governing_framework": [
            "Intergranular frictional cohesion maintaining structural integrity",
            "Dynamic particle rearrangement under applied stress",
            "Thermally driven Brownian-like microscale motion"
          ],
          "driving_forces_and_potential": [
            "Interparticle frictional energy dissipation",
            "Pore pressure gradient-induced fluidization potential",
            "Thermally activated particle displacement dynamics"
          ],
          "foundational_state": "A polydisperse granular matrix with 63% particles in 0.1-0.5mm size range, 28% in 0.05-0.1mm range, and 9% fine dust, exhibiting 125 Pa effective stress and 0.85 void ratio at 20°C."
        }
      }
    ],
    "governing_framework": [ /* ... */ ],
    "driving_forces_and_potential": [ /* ... */ ],
    "foundational_state": "The stone occupies a stable equilibrium position..." /* ... */
  }
}
```

*We continue to unveil the world, adding a detailed structure for "sand" alongside the already existing "stone" structure. Both objects now have their `manifestation` blocks at the first level of detail.*

#### Delving into Quartz Crystal (within the Stone)

Let's go even deeper, focusing on "Quartz Crystal," which is part of the "Stone." The `navigate` command is capable of finding this nested entity:

```bash
demi navigate 'Quartz Crystal' --input world.json --output world.json
```

The world's JSON structure will now contain a new, nested `"manifestation"` block for "Quartz Crystal" inside the "stone's" `manifestation`:

```json
{
  "discovery": { /* ... */ },
  "navigation": {
    "max_depth": 2, // Depth increased, as we've delved to a new level
    "history": [
      { "date": "2025-06-26 21:51:31", "prompt": "stone" },
      { "date": "2025-06-26 22:05:43", "prompt": "sand" },
      { "date": "2025-07-04 23:36:03", "prompt": "Quartz Crystal" } // New history entry added
    ]
  },
  "world": {
    "essence": "A minimalist physical system...", /* ... */
    "primary_constituents": [
      {
        "name": "stone",

DEMI correctly found "Quartz Crystal" within the already "manifested" stone and unveiled it to an atomic level, demonstrating hierarchical delving and the immutability of the world's internal logic. Now `max_depth` has reached 2.

#### Conclusion

This example clearly demonstrates the key principles of **DEMI** and the **SRGC** model. It shows how the `navigate` command doesn't just create new details but acts as a **"semantic lens"** that **unveils** the world's already existing, potential complexity. Each delve, like an act of "observation," concretizes a fragment of reality, adding new `manifestation` layers while ensuring complete internal hierarchical consistency from high-level concepts to the smallest components. This emphasizes the role of **LLM** as a **semantic core** that manifests, rather than arbitrarily generates, world structures.

## Manifesto: The Vision Behind Project Demiurg

DEMI is more than just a world generator; it's an **engine for creating autonomous, living, self-sufficient realities**, **structured by SRGC**. These worlds exist by their own internal laws, not for a player or an observer.

*   **Semantic Core:** We use language to forge miniature universes, with the LLM serving as their breath.
*   **SRGC, Not Ontology:** This is not just text; it's an **SRGC-structured reality** – an ordered collection of entities, their relationships, laws, and driving forces.
*   **Witness, Not Author:** You are not an author, player, or god; you are a **witness to an alien reality**, observing worlds where events unfold for their own internal reasons, not for us or because of us, **as dictated by SRGC.**
*   **LLM as Law:** The world lives by itself. The LLM acts as the **physical law governing its existence**, **manifesting its structure in accordance with SRGC.**
*   **Challenging Reality:** This is a **pocket-sized metaphysical experiment**, designed to unlock the true potential of language models—even small ones—and push the boundaries of what constitutes "reality" **through the lens of SRGC.**
