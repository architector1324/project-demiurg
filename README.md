# Project Demiurg

**Project Demiurg** - A semantic engine for generating internally consistent fictional realities, from quantum voids to dream cities, using world synthesis based on text queries (prompts) and LLMs following the SRGC representation model.

## Overview

**DEMI** (the **Project Demiurg Engine** tool) is a system that transforms text queries into **self-contained fictional realities**, structured according to the **SRGC representation model**. Utilizing a multi-agent system based on local **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), it generates semantic [JSON](https://www.json.org) structures that don't just describe, but also form the foundation for the existence and evolution of complex worlds in accordance with their own internal logic, adhering to **SRGC principles**.

Whether you're creating a simulation, a narrative universe, or an abstract conceptual model, DEMI provides a fundamental structure based on pure semantic meaning.

## Key Concepts

To fully understand DEMI, it is crucial to distinguish between the engine itself and the unique model of reality it employs and generates:

*   **DEMI (Project Demiurg Engine):** This is the **active system, engine, or tool**. DEMI is the software (a combination of LLMs, your scripts, the system prompt, and commands) that **executes the process of generating, unfolding (manifesting), and querying** worlds. It accepts user queries and, using LLMs, creates or modifies world structures. DEMI is the **mechanism** that allows you to interact with reality.

*   **SRGC (Semantic Reality with Gradient Concretization):** This is the **unique conceptual model, metaphysical structure, or the "nature" of reality itself** that DEMI generates and interacts with. Unlike traditional, static ontologies, SRGC describes a reality in which entities exist on a **gradient spectrum of concretization** – from abstract concepts and undifferentiated groups to precisely manifested components.
    *   **The core idea of SRGC:** World details initially exist in a state of **potential and uncertainty**, and they **"materialize" (manifest)** on demand, without violating the world's internal logic. This allows a world to contain, for example, both **concrete, fully manifested entities** and **undefined groups** (e.g., "one apple" and "the remaining apples in the basket" can correctly coexist in a single SRGC-structure, where "the remaining apples" is an entity with the potential for further concretization, not an error). SRGC allows reality to be **partially concretized** until the moment of "observation."

*   **World as Synergy:** A world in DEMI is an **emergent reality** that arises from the synergy between a structured map (JSON, created by the SRGC model) and a language model (LLM). The JSON is not the world itself, but its **potential**, containing meanings and rules. The LLM is not merely a text generator, but an **engine** that **unfolds** this potential. Together, they create a **micro-dimension** – a dynamic, logically coherent system that you can explore using commands like `navigate` and `query`. This is not static text or imagination, but a living informational reality that exists through interaction.

## Interactive Exploration

For a more intuitive understanding of DEMI's structured outputs, we offer tools for visualizing generated realities:

### Local Visualizer

An interactive graph visualizer is available for local use, allowing you to explore the **gradient concretization structure** of DEMI worlds directly on your machine.

*   **Location:** The standalone visualizer is located at [`visualizer/visualizer.ru.html`](./visualizer/visualizer.ru.html) in this repository.
*   **Usage:** Open `visualizer.html` in your web browser. You can paste any generated DEMI JSON output into the text field or load an example to see its internal structure as a dynamic, unfolding graph.

### Project Online Hub

For a general overview of DEMI and an integrated experience, a dedicated project website is available.

## Motivation / Philosophy

DEMI was born from a desire to explore the true capabilities of Large Language Models beyond simple conversation or data extraction. It represents a **metaphysical experiment** - a quest to use LLMs as semantic engines capable of constructing self-sufficient, internally consistent realities, **governed by SRGC**. The project aims to demonstrate that even smaller, locally run models can serve as a "semantic core," enabling the creation and simulation of complex worlds at any level of detail, entirely independent of external human interpretation, **in accordance with its principles**. This project challenges the very notion of what constitutes "reality" and how it can be synthetically generated **through the lens of SRGC.**

## Core Features

DEMI offers a powerful set of capabilities designed to bring complex realities to life:

*   **Prompt-Based Reality Synthesis:** Simply provide a brief text query, and DEMI will generate a unique, detailed fictional reality, tailored to your vision, **structured by SRGC.**
*   **Deep SRGC-Structure:** Each generated world is represented as a **structured JSON representation**, meticulously defining its existence across five core dimensions, **consistent with its reality framework**. This is not just text; it's a blueprint of a living world:
    *   `essence`: The fundamental nature and defining concept of the reality.
    *   `primary_constituents`: The main entities, elements, or principles that form its foundation.
    *   `governing_framework`: The internal laws and rules that define the world's operating principles.
    *   `driving_forces_and_potential`: Dynamic elements that drive change, evolution, and create narrative possibilities.
    *   `foundational_state`: The initial conditions and primal state from which the reality originates.
*   **Unprecedented Consistency and Versatility:** DEMI ensures **genre-independent** and **internally consistent** semantic synthesis. Whether you're exploring the intricacies of quantum physics or the grim depths of cyberpunk, the generated realities will always adhere to their own logical structure.
*   **Pure Internal Logic:** Unlike typical game or narrative engines, DEMI focuses exclusively on the **internal logic of the world itself**, **defined by SRGC principles**. There is no "player orientation" here – reality exists independently, driven by its own internal dynamics.
*   **Reality as Observation:** Worlds created by DEMI are inherently infinitely complex and possess the potential for infinite detail. However, due to technical limitations in storing an infinite volume of data on a computer, their representation acquires a **quantum nature**, **consistent with its nature**: world details are initially **undetermined and in a state of potentiality**, similar to quantum mechanics principles. They **"materialize" and manifest** only upon targeted **"observation"** or focus from the user (via the `navigate` command), **in accordance with SRGC's gradient concretization principle.**

    **Important: This does not contradict the declared independence of the world from an external observer.** The LLM acts as an **"unfolder" of its inherent complexity**, not its arbitrary generator. An external observer, by requesting a deeper dive, does not **alter** the world or its internal laws, nor introduces anything external. They merely **prompt the world to "unfold"** that part of its structure which is already intrinsically embedded within its fundamental semantic fabric, **following its rules**. This process always occurs **strictly in accordance with the internal rules and logic of the reality itself**. Thus, the observer does not create a new reality, but rather **explores** an already existing one, merely moving to a deeper level of its manifestation. This ensures that even with deep exploration, the world remains absolutely internally consistent and true to its original laws.
*   **Local and Autonomous:** Run DEMI entirely on your computer without an internet connection. Powered by Ollama, it provides a self-contained environment for generating and exploring realities.

## Semantic Navigation (Reality Unfolding)

The `navigate` command is the primary mechanism for **exploring and unfolding the inherent, granular layers** of an already generated reality, **as defined by SRGC**. It embodies the principle of **"Reality as Observation"**: where world details exist in a state of potentiality and **materialize (unfold)** upon targeted intent. This is not arbitrary generation; instead, it is the **semantic unfolding** of pre-existing, internal complexity, logically deriving from the parent entity and the world's general laws, **all governed by SRGC principles.**

Imagine a vast, multi-dimensional map where initially only large continents are visible. `navigate` acts as a zoom function, sequentially revealing cities, then streets, then individual buildings. All these details **already existed** on the map; they simply weren't "rendered" at that particular level of detail.

When `navigate` is invoked, the user specifies a focal point or conceptual path (e.g., "A drop of water", "A woman at a table"). The system (the LLM, guided by the system prompt) acts as a **sophisticated semantic lens, interpreting the query and revealing relevant hierarchical levels, consistent with SRGC's gradient concretization.** This process then adds detailed `manifestation` objects to the world's JSON structure.

**Crucially, when an entity manifests, it reveals not only its `primary_constituents`, but also its own internal `essence`, `governing_framework`, `driving_forces_and_potential`, and `foundational_state` – all strictly derived from the parent entity and the general logic of the world, and **consistent with its principles of coherence**. This ensures that every unfolded detail maintains the full **internal integrity** of the reality.**

**Key Features:**

*   **Hierarchical Consistency:** All elements within a `manifestation` (its internal constituents, laws, and forces) are direct, more specific **consequences or deeper manifestations** of the parent entity's description and the parent world's governing structure, ensuring continuous logical integrity **within the model.**
*   **Semantic Pathfinding and Unfolding:** The LLM does not require an exact name match. It **interprets** the user's query within the existing **structure** and **semantically determines the logical path** to the specified focus. If the requested entity is deeply nested, the model **recursively unfolds the entire chain of manifestation**, revealing the necessary intermediate `manifestation` levels.
    *   Example: If a user requests `navigate 'a woman at a table in a restaurant'`, when the world is described down to "New York," the model will unfold the chain: `City -> District -> Building -> Restaurant -> Table -> Woman`, adding new `manifestation` objects at each level.
*   **Focused Detailing:** For larger entities, the command intelligently focuses on the most relevant subcomponents, consolidating most other parts into a single representative entity (e.g., `"Other components [Entity Name]"`), preventing excessive data proliferation.
*   **Internal and Objective:** In alignment with DEMI's core philosophy, the output is entirely devoid of an external observational perspective, describing the world purely from within itself. The user does not *create* a new reality, but rather *explores* and *observes* the unfolding of an already existing one, merely moving to a deeper level of its manifestation.

The command returns the **complete, modified JSON of the world**, where the selected constituent is updated or created with its new, deeper manifestation. This allows for recursive exploration, creating an increasingly detailed **SRGC-structured map** of your fictional reality.

### **Semantic Navigation in Action: Unfolding a Woman in a Metropolis**

This example demonstrates the **true power of semantic navigation (unfolding)** - not just detailing entities, but **recursively revealing logical hierarchies and their full definitions** in response to a query, as well as brilliantly embodying the **"Reality as Observation"** principle, where world details manifest upon user focus.

**Initial World State (abridged, `world.json`):**
```json
{
  "essence": "A vast, interconnected urban center defined by dense population, complex infrastructure...",
  "primary_constituents": [
    {
      "name": "Urban Core",
      "description": "The central business district, characterized by skyscrapers..."
    },
    // ... other primary constituents
  ],
  // ... other world dimensions
}
```

**Navigation Query:**
```bash
demi navigate 'A woman sitting at a table in a restaurant' --model qwen3 --input world.json
```

**Result (schematic representation of unfolded reality, showing full chain of manifestations with expanded depth):**
*(Only the key unfolding chain is shown for brevity. The complete, corrected JSON with full details is available [here](./examples/Typical%20metropolis/A%20woman%20sitting%20at%20a%20table%20in%20a%20restaurant/world.json).)*

**What this outstanding example demonstrates:**
*   **Deep Unfolding at Each Level:** The model successfully constructed the manifestation chain: `Metropolis (implicit) -> Urban Core -> Restaurant -> Table -> Woman`. More importantly, at *each* new `manifestation` level, the LLM revealed not only new `primary_constituents`, but also its specific `essence`, `governing_framework`, `driving_forces_and_potential`, and `foundational_state`. This is crucial, as it shows that the world reveals its own nested internal logic, not just its components, **in accordance with its principles.**
*   **Context-Oriented Revelation and Philosophical Adherence:** The "Woman" entity was detailed not only down to abstract states (`Physical Form`, `Consciousness`, `Sociocultural Identity`), but her unfolding also included *her own* specific biological, social, and cultural governing structures and driving forces. This perfectly aligns with the project's philosophy that the world reveals *itself* and its inherent logic, **as expressed by SRGC principles.**
*   **Internal Coherence:** The model independently determined the relevance and depth of detail, strictly adhering to the world's internal logic, without external instructions or level constraints. DEMI does not "invent," but rather "manifests" what semantically exists within its foundational principles.
*   **Confirmation of "Reality as Observation" Principle:** The user's query served as an act of "observation" that caused the world to "unfold" and reveal its internal complexity along the specified path, without creating new entities outside its inherent logic. The world unfolds; it is not created.

## Manifesto: The Vision Behind Project Demiurg

DEMI is more than just a world generator; it is an **engine for creating autonomous, living, self-sufficient realities**, **structured by SRGC**. These worlds exist by their own internal laws, not for the sake of a player or an observer.

*   **Semantic Core:** We use language to forge miniature universes, with the LLM serving as their breath.
*   **SRGC, not Ontology:** This is not merely text; it is an **SRGC-structured reality** – an ordered aggregate of entities, their relationships, laws, and driving forces.
*   **Witness, not Author:** You are not an author, player, or god; you are a **witness to an alien reality**, observing worlds where events unfold for their own internal reasons, not for us or because of us, **as dictated by SRGC.**
*   **LLM as Law:** The world lives on its own. The LLM acts as the **physical law governing its existence**, **manifesting its structure according to SRGC.**
*   **Challenge to Reality:** This is a **metaphysical experiment in pocket format**, designed to reveal the true potential of language models – even small ones – and push the boundaries of what constitutes "reality" **through the lens of SRGC.**
